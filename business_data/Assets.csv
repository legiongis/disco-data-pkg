The Dean and Chapter were given license in 1285 to enclose the Cathedral precinct, for reasons of personal safety, with a wall of 12ft (3.64m.) It is probable that building did not commence immediately, as further grants were made in 1315 and afterwards. In 1316, licence was granted to crenellate and in 1318 to raise the height and build turrets. The work was complete by 1327. The wall east and west of D Isney Tower was made narrower and refaced in stone and brick, perhaps in the 16th century. The wall has been repaired at various times from the 17th to the 20th centuries. A section to the rear of the White Hart Hotel was removed in 1734 with the permission of the Dean and Chapter (Hill GL p4.) Part was exposed at Greestone Mount in 2002, with evidence of internal thickening. The wall is a Listed Building with its different sections and gates having separate references. 1)1941-1/7/90 5 East Bight. 2) 1941-1/9/109 25 Eastgate. 3) 1941-1/9/116 Exchequergate Lodge. 4) 1941-1/9/122 Greestone Stairs with arch and wall). 5) 1941-1/9/226 The Priory, 2 Minster Yard and attached Close Wall 6) 1941-1/9/249 Between 16A Minster Yard and the Deanery. 7) 1941-1/9/452 To south and west of Edward King House. 8) In Temple Gardens 1941-1/9/383. 9) Tower and section of Close wall bordering grounds of 5 Pottergate. 1941-1/10/401. 10) 1941-1/10/305 Pottergate Arch. 11) 1941-1/9/253 Wall at Deanery. 12) 1941-1/9/254 Exchequergate.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It is known that his body was transferred to the purpose-built Angel Choir in 1280. No traces of a shrine or in situ burials were found within the chapel. The 1986 excavations found mortared and faced limestone foundations approximately 1.8m wide with a relieving arch. The chapel walls were c 1.5m wide, and there were 6-sided buttresses at the north-east and south-east corners, with smaller buttresses on the north and south walls. Foundations rested at east end on askew foundations. After partial demolition in 1772, there may have been an antiquarian excavation of the interior by James Essex.

Investigations in 2003, however, revealed a stone apse to the north of the wall, which aligned with it, and part of an apse within and under the cathedral (recorded in the 19th century and marked on the floor in the north aisle of St Hughs choir). This led the excavators to favour a Roman date, but the stratigraphy and size of the walls make this unlikely (more likely to be Norman - pers comm M J Jones).""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

There were no foundations as such, being based on the rammed fill of the legionary-period ditch. (An earlier and narrower wall, c.1.5m wide dated from the early-mid 2nd century.) The wall contained mortar in its rubble core; the west face was pinkish, the refaced east face more yellow. All the exposed east face was clearly later than the original wall, consisting of at least two phases of work. The lowest three courses of this face consisted of large blocks terminating at a vertical joint to the north, suggesting a void here at some point. It may have been the south jamb of a postern gate inserted through the wall in the later Roman period, or part of a later fortification (see MON45). It was thickened internally in the late 3rd/4th century with roughly-laid limestone in pinkish mortar. Foundations at least 3m wide at cat86 excavations. Wall levelled in late 12th century and reused as foundations for eastwards choir extension of the Cathedral. A small section of the Roman wall is visible on the south side of the Cathedral. Limestone blocks were recorded to the east of the inner gate to the Bishops Palace in 2003; possibly waste material from the wall reused for medieval defences.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It probably dates from the building of the castle curtain wall/inner bailey and the blocking of the Roman west gate, when any existing street would have been re-routed to the present position to the north. There was also a lane to the north of Westgate which it probably superseded. It had the name Westgate in 1802, then St Pauls Lane but was officially renamed Westgate in 1830 by the Lighting and Paving Commissioners. Padleys 1842 map shows the street only built up as follows; north side; from Bailgate west to just east of the Mint Wall; from West Bight westwards c. 50m; south side; Castle Dykings at the west end; Brummitts Ropery (now coach park and housing) and row of c.12 houses (now car park). It was widened west of the junction with West Bight in the 1880s, with the removal of several houses.

Inside were a metalled surface, mortar floor, flagstones and a large oven. A rear extension contained a pit with a pot inside, and there was a wall prop to support the north wall. The north wall was rebuilt, and a succession of two ovens added, with clay floors and timber partitions. There may have been a house fire in the late 4th century, but the building continued in use for a while afterwards, with stake holes, post holes, an oven and cut features indicating internal rearrangements, with evidence of painted plaster. A complete pot was found in a pot pit. Finds indicated a stone slate roof, at least in part.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The resurfacings were interleaved with at least three ""clearly recognisable layers of occupation material"". Curved gully and a soakaway may have been for road drainage. Height difference north-south lessened as makeup continued. It has been postulated that it is part of a street (MON722) also recorded further south at Hungate (MON375). The alignment, at odds with the north-south grid, is difficult to explain, however. It may be that the surface at Hungate was only a yard. Work at Michaelgate in 1997, to the north, did not find the road, but two buildings appeared to lie on either side of its projected line. Further work at Michaelgate in 1999 (mgb99) did not find the road either, but a compact deposit in the projected position may represent a sub-base material.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The west end of the church of St Peter Stanthaket was found and excavated; the nave was probably built in stone in the mid/late 11th century. A tower was added to the west of the nave in the 12th century, and a southern extension, either a chapel, aisle or porch, was built in the 13th century. The ground was terraced level before construction. It was called Stanteked / Stantheked in 12C. and also St Peter in foro pellium/ad forum pellium (St Peter in the skin market).

Two ""very handsome"" Roman tessellated pavements were found in 1786, along with a Roman bath, some coins and samian fragments, probably during the construction of the 1787 prison. They are described by Richmond as ""A rough plan of the pavements is contained in the Monson Library, Burton Hall, which specifies the pavements as 9 feet 9 inches (2.97m) from east to west, by 4 feet 5 inches (1.35m) from north to south, with an oblong 4 feet (1.22m) north to south by 6 feet (1.83m) east to west, opening off the south side of the first"". They were in the possession of a Mr Samuel in 1787 (SM 30/11/1787 p3).  A third Roman tessellated pavement was found in 1846 at the Castle prison. It measured 17 x 12 feet, (5.18m by 3.66m) extended over a hypocaust, and was discovered 12 feet (3.66m) below ground level (given to The Mechanics Institute). (Derby Mercury 25/02/1846 p3 col 3).

It was a pipeline with a bore of 14.5cm encased in opus signinum (concrete) running underground adjacent to and parallel to Nettleham Road on its north side. It has been recorded from 117 Nettleham Road to 87 Nettleham Road, but not further south. At 117 Nettleham Road pieces of the piping were found reused in the walls of an outbuilding dating from the 18th century.  At 87 Nettleham Road was a stone platform c 2.75m wide, designed to carry the aqueduct over a depression, perhaps 65m long MON8420). Ten pier bases were found close to the Roaring Meg spring to carry the pipeline above ground to the higher land to the south, from where it continued underground to Lincoln. Other structures at the spring, such as a large stone platform (MON1517), have been considered to be part of a pumping system at the source at this point. A track or hard standing (MON1516), and post holes and ditches near the platform were examined in 1998. It has also been suggested that the source of water was further north; no evidence of this has been found. It was not seen during construction of the western by-pass in 1984, c.240m to the north of the Roaring Meg spring. The lack of limescale in the pipe suggests that it was never used at all, although slight furring (0.5mm thick) was recorded in the pipe at 93 Nettleham Road in 2006. There has not been agreement about the method by which water could have been raised to a height sufficient for a fall to the city. It is not known for certain where the pipeline entered the city. The water tank (MON751) found at East Bight was the possible destination, and M J Jones considers that it may have entered the city either by way of Newport Arch, or was carried over the ditch at East Bight. A length of piping found near Greestone Stairs may be part of a supply to the Lower City. It has also been suggested that the aqueduct carried water, not to, but, from the city to the area of the spring, which may have had religious significance, as a show of Roman engineering power to the local inhabitants.  Gough recorded the aqueduct in 1806 and drew a circular feature north of the spring (MON8419). A section of pipe was on display at Waitrose supermarket until 2014.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It was the nearest to Clasket gate of the Butwerk churches, on the south of the site of the old Sessions House, now part of Lincoln College. Also called St Romwalds / Rumwalds in the Swine Market. St Rumbold suggests Flemish dedication. The parish had no inhabitants in 1428 and the church was gone by 1549. Archaeological evidence of the church was found in the evaluation and watching brief of 1997. (nb Marrat maps place it on the site of St Hughs RC Church). The location of St Rumbold is confused in print. Until c.1990 the church was said to be on the corner of St Rumbolds Street and Friars Lane. C Johnson has now confirmed that documentary evidence places the church on the site of the Old Sessions House, and archaeology has supported this view.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The chancel was rebuilt in 1864, architect Michael Drury, and the nave extended and restored in 1887, architect C Hodgson Fowler (d 1910), with new spired turret and seating. The contractor was W Cowper of Campsall near Doncaster, and the reopening was held in November 1887. The cemetery was extended to more than an acre in 1928, funded by public subscription. Once Boultham Hall estate became a public park, Boultham Park, the church was still used publicly, but its functions were mostly taken over by the new Holy Cross Church in 1940. There are occasional services, such as weddings, funerals and a Christmas Carol Service. The churchyard contains a granite memorial, from the fortifications of Sebastopol during the Crimean War.

Naturally occurring but much altered port area into which flows the upper Witham from the south and the Fossdyke, a canal cut south of the original River Till, from the west. After 1700 gradual develoPaul Milesent of the banks took place with wharves and warehouses, mostly privately built, especially with improvements to Fossdyke and increase of water transport after 1740s. A 1779 map shows the south foreshore much further south, in the area of St Marks. The 19th century saw reclamation of the Holmes Common, consolidation of the wharves and building of bigger warehouses, flour and silk mills, granaries, breweries and maltings, water transport depots, boat and barge builders, coal and timber yards, public houses and various offices and commercial dealers in agricultural and other products. Cleansing by dredging took place in 1843, 1856/7 and 1895 (Lincs Chronicle). The Corporation Electricity Works was built in 1898, needing a ready source of water. At the western end the Corporation established a public wharf. Problems with obstruction of the wharves and public access continued throughout the 19th century as did restricted passage through Glory Hole under High Bridge to connect the Fossdyke with the Witham and Boston. Commercial use declined after the growth and resiting at New Boultham of the major engineering companies at the end of the century and the increasing dominance of railway transport. Extensive dredging took place in 1932 to clear the bottom of silt. Most of the buildings on the east wharf, including Dickinson‰Ûªs Mill and the Holmes Grain Warehouse, survived until the early 1970s, when Wigford Way was constructed (in 1972). The last early waterside structure on East Wharf, Hercocks Banana warehouse, was demolished in 1993. The north wharf has also been almost completely changed since the 1970s. Pre-1945 surviving buildings consist of the electricity works and the Royal William IV Public house. The Pool and its surrounding wharves are now exclusively used for leisure pursuits, mainly bars and restaurants, cinema, offices and tourism.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It probably originally had a timber well-head, replaced in stone in the late 2nd/early 3rd century. The well-head was 4m square and 2m high externally, made of limestone blocks with courses of tile. Four brick relieving arches under the well-head restricted the shaft to width of 1.2m, with the shaft itself c2.4m in diameter. Located in a room in east range of the later forum. It probably was in use until the 4th century. It may have been used as a source of water for Christian baptism before and after the construction of the first church on the site, which was aligned to it, and may have continued in use until the late Saxon period when the well-head was robbed of stone. It may have become buried under the cemetery which was extended eastwards in late 12th century, but it was reopened in the 14th century, with a rebuilt well-head, after any backfill was cleaned out. Backfilling in the 17th-18th centuries resulted in a large and important finds assemblage (see Archibald et al 2008). The backfilling may have begun c1644 and continued as a deliberate act of puritan iconoclasm until c 1678. It later was use as a dump for roof tile, possibly from St Pauls Church itself.

A new colonia gateway was constructed c. AD200.

Possibly originally the Citys Guildhall, granted to the friars in 1237, but stylistically appears to belong to beginning of friary. It was probably used by them as a church, and an infirmary in its second phase. After dissolution in 1538/9, it became the private property of William Monson, whose son Lord Justice Robert Monson conveyed it to the Corporation in 1567 or 1574 to be the Corporation Grammar School. It had been a free school since 1568, on the upper floor. It merged with the Dean and Chapter School in 1588. The school occupied the upper floor while the undercroft housed the to the House of Correction from 1612 and from 1693 the Jersey School until 1831; 1833-1862 the Mechanics Institution set up a library, and a museum of natural history and Roman finds, in the undercroft. Brick annexe added to east end in mid 1800s. The Grammar School moved to Lindum Terrace in 1884, leaving the Middle School at Greyfriars. It was completely closed c1900, and was restored and added to in 1906 after survey and recommendations by architects W Watkins and Son, and converted into a museum 1906/7 (opening 22/5/1907), and used as such until 2 October 2004, except when occupied by the Central Library in 1994-5.  An archway abutment on the west gable was removed in 1996.

The walkway was made accessible in the 1990s-2000s on all sides except the southern portion between the south-west corner, Lucy Tower and the Observatory Tower. This part is due to be opened in 2011. There is a northern gateway leading on to the berm overlooking Westgate. Evaluation of the motte and Lucy Tower in 2010 suggested that the southern stretch formed an internal division, with the Roman wall to the south forming the outer wall, until the 13th century.

The motte may date from the first phase of castle building in 1068. Probably originally fortified, possibly with a wooden tower, by the Countess Lucy between 1129 and 1136, but with the keep itself built by her son Ranulph c.1145-55. The keep has externally flat buttresses with roll moulded set-offs, and is set on a limestone rubble-built foundation of up to three courses as observed on the south-east side. There is evidence, partly from recording in 2010, that there were east and west wings on the south side of the curtain wall attached to the keep, with stronger evidence for the eastern wing. In 1991 a survey was made revealing two small chambers to the east, and a garderobe at the west end of the keep. These have proved to be small towers attached to the west and east of the Lucy Tower.  The small towers appear to have contained private chambers provided with fireplaces and garderobes (toilet) chambers. The main north-western entrance, reached by a 19th-century flight of steps, has a segmental arch with a moulding dated to the mid 12th century. An inquisition report of 1327 described the Lucy Tower as having been ""ruined within memory"". By 1634, the interior of the keep was described as containing only a garden. Tower much restored in 1835-6 with repairs to the keep and a new flight of steps. (Willson). The interior was used as a cemetery for prisoners during the 19th century (MON4908). The original profile of the motte may have been levelled at its base in the post-medieval period (2009 boreholes). The motte was cut into at its base on the south-eastern side for the landscaping of the garden of Castle Moat House in the early 19th century, with 2 or three terraced walkways and a concrete staircase inserted into the slope. Trees began to grow on the slope from the early 19th century; they were removed in 2010""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

Situated in the north-east of the castle, it contains two chambers with rib vaults on two storeys, originally three. There are four vaulted cells on the lower floor, which is reached by ladder/stairs from upper floor which contains six radial cells. Recessed slit windows. The tiled roof was removed in 1815 and other works carried out to enable the roof to be used for executions (the New Drop), with public executions from 1817 to 1859; (the first private execution in the Castle, of Priscilla Biggadike, was in January 1869.)  Fittings are visible on the parapet. Reduced in height and remodelled in the 19th century, (?by E J Willson). Willson explained the name Cobb as coming from cobbing, an ancient punishment for small offences (SM 04/08/1848).""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

(See also MON865) The water was conveyed from springs to the north of Monks Road via a conduit also serving a conduit head at Greyfriary and a faucet at High Bridge. It continued in use in the post-medieval period. The tap was moved from the west side to the south side in 1828, and the whole structure was repositioned to its present site in March-April 1864, slightly further away (eastwards) from the High Street, level with the wall of St Mary le Wigfords Church, and restoring the tap to the west side. The contractor was W Huddleston (SM 15/04/1864 p5 col 7). It was after this that the pipeline was extended south to St Peter at Gowts Church. It last supplied water in 1906. Nb the 1930 OS map still marks it as drinking fountain. It was restored by Lincoln Civic Trust in 1954 and 1979""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It is reputed to have been a 12th-century synagogue, with a niche in the east wall considered to be the ark, but this is not proven and the architectural style appears to be of later date; in 1824, however, it was referred to as the Jews Synagogue when offered for sale as a leasehold messuage from the Dean and Chapter (SM 08/10/1824 p 2 col 2). Timber lintel beams over windows in facade. It was divided into four or five tenements (1-5 Jews Court), possibly by 1766 and certainly by 1841 and up until 1925; 2 and 3 Steep Hill referred to the two basements. In 1876-1881, it also held St Michaels Mission Room (press, directory and census). It was sold privately in 1910 to Edward Hauxwell Dodgson, a solicitor and antiquarian of Leeds for å£200 (SM 25/03/1910 p5), and bought by Lincoln Corporation in April 1925 for å£300, when the tenants were rehoused. In 1928 there was a proposal to demolish it in a programme of slum clearance, but after opposition to this move from the Lincolnshire Architectural and Archaeological Society, the building was conferred in 1929 as a gift to the Society, which undertook a programme of restoration and internal alterations between Dec 1931 and Oct 1932, contractor Arthur Howson and Sons of Lincoln.  (Abell Collection, LCL). 1949 Moral Welfare Association; 1975, Regional Craft Centre; then Society for Lincs History and Archaeology to date. New roof covering constructed in April-June 2003. In 1989 some reused medieval architectural fragments were observed in the foundations of the south and west rear walls. In the southern basement, the wooden and brick flooring were removed in April-June 2003, and new brick floor laid on compacted hardcore and lime sand bed. This required the removal of c.10cm of sub-surface at the west side of the basement. It consisted of compacted material with very small pieces of brick limestone, clay, mortar and patches of burning, containing post-medieval and modern pottery and finds.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It has been suggested (Alan Vince- City by the Pool) that it was constructed in two phases; first with the cutting of Great Gowt (MON914) to enclose the northern part of Wigford in the early/mid 10th century, followed in the late 11th century by the southern stretch, when the suburb expanded southwards. It also functioned as a defensive barrier for the medieval suburb of Wigford and was a ""natural"" property boundary. First documentary references are in the 13th century, the Dyke sometimes called the ""Old Eye"" and ""Kings Dyke"", and ""Silver Dyke"" in the 14th. 1628 Synshall Dyke. In the late post-medieval period, it was recut slightly to the east and north, at least in the area of Knight Place and Bargate Bridge. Documentary sources refer to an accompanying internal bank. It leaves the Witham at Altham Terrace, flows east under Bargate Bridge [this section is called Great Bargate Drain on Padley‰Ûªs 1819-1830 map), and Little Bargate bridge, before turning north along Sincil Bank. It probably rejoined the Witham close to modern Sincil Street but this part was back-filled, perhaps in c 1500 and the watercourse was diverted east at the southern end of Sincil Street, joining the Witham at Stamp End, or perhaps not so far east, as Speed (1607) and Armstrongs (1779) maps show the confluence roughly on a line with Rosemary Lane. This junction was itself closed off in 1826 and the Dyke continued further east, parallel to the south of the Witham, and probably joining it in the area of Spa Road. This new line left a natural dock basin stretching south from the Witham, used by Clayton and Shuttleworth until gradually filled in during the late 19th century. The Dyke is labelled Catchwater Drain on Padley 1819-1830 map east of Stamp End. This line was changed again c1850 at the same point (south end of the dock basin), swinging south-westwards on its current line, the railway line of the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway following the previous route of the Dyke. This new route changes into the South Delph c1880s and the Dyke effectively ceases to be so named just to the west of Enterprise House. The east turn at Sincil Street was changed in 1826, the corner being smoothed out into a gentler curve to the east. A sluice and weir regulate the flow at Altham Terrace. The section between the railway station and Pelham /Melville Streets, with Napoleon Place on the south side, was culverted and covered in 1955. Norman Street was re-routed over the new land thus created. Large scale deepening, reconstruction of banks in concrete and replacement of bridges and handrails on Sincil Bank took place in 1963-4.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The Castle (MON449) was constructed in the south-west quarter of the Upper walled city from c.1068. The Roman east-west wall between the Upper and Lower Cities had ceased to have a meaningful purpose from the time of the creation of the Lower walled city in the 2nd century, and on the west side was covered by the Castle south bank. The Wigford suburb (MON1461, MON5534) was defended by Sincil Dyke (MON696), with gates at Bargate (MON699) and Little Bargate (MON700). It seems there was a wall (MON460) between the two gates, but its existence north of Little Bargate, and at the west side of the suburb, has been questioned although marked on 19th-century maps. A bank and ditch (MON694,695), surrounded Newport suburb (MON1450), and Newport Arch was partially rebuilt (MON1008). Clasketgate (MON704) continued to serve as the way to the east and north-east, and to the suburb of Butwerk (MON1145). The south-west entrance was from Newland Gate (MON701), and there may have been other gates to the north at West Parade and near the old Roman lower west gate at City Hall, Orchard Street (MON1428). Documents refer to a ditch and gate (MON911) marking the western extent of Newland suburb. The Citys west wall was extended south to the Brayford to the new Lucy Tower (MON702). A postern gate was inserted in the wall at Motherby Hill (MON1351). A postern gate, ""Le Posterne by Westcastel"" (MON946) was almost certainly a gate constructed to replace the Roman west gate of the upper city, following the relocation of Westgate along the outer edge of the castle ditch. An extended wall and a tower matching Lucy Tower was built on the east side near the site of the Green Dragon PH (MON705), with a postern gate through the east wall on the site of the Library (MON1081). The southern entrance was the Roman gate, or perhaps an unknown Norman replacement, rebuilt in 1450 as the Stonebow (MON601).""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

Brauncegate continued west of the High Street as St Martins Church is located there in documents of the 1460s. The area has been considered to have been the area inhabited by Jews until the expulsion of 1290. It is possible, as suggested by Speeds 1607 map, that the street formerly continued directly eastwards to the Clasket gate, rather than ending at Danesgate and being diverted south to Clasketgate as today.  A scatter of limestone rubble found at Flaxengate excavations may have been the north edge of the street c.1100, to the north of the modern extent.  Probably named after the Grantham family.

It rises c16km north west of Stamford, flows north through Grantham to Lincoln, entering Brayford Pool at the Holmes Crossing at Brayford Wharf East and leaving it at Brayford Head. It continues along Waterside, through Stamp End and eastwards, before turning south east before Bardney and running to Boston, then reaching the Wash at Claypole. The part before Lincoln is the upper Witham. The value of the lower Witham was for vessels to reach the sea en route to London and elsewhere, not only from Lincoln, but also from the Midlands via the Trent and Fossdyke. It is not known when the river was first canalised, but it was possibly during the Roman occupation. Sincil Dyke, leaving the Witham at Altham Terrace and rejoining it at Stamp End, may have been dug at the same time. By 1750 the Witham was in a serious state of disrepair with broken banks and regular flooding. Between 1762 and 1770 improvements were made, including Stamp End lock, a new sluice at Boston and the recutting of the channel from there to the sea. The meanders between Chapel Hill and Boston were eliminated by a new channel. The shallow and narrow section at High Bridge was improved but continued to cause problems. When the river was high there was insufficient headroom under the bridges. There was an increase in the level of river trade in the first half of the 19th century. Sailing barges were the norm but in 1809 horse-drawn, and in 1816 steam packets came into use. Further improvements were carried out 1812-1830s. Bore hole evidence (2004) showed that the upper Witham south of Brayford extended further west than the present course.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It was in the possession of Osbert the sheriff in the early 12th century, but was given to Bishop Bloet by Henry I upon the death of Osbert. The parish was united with St Peter at Arches in the early 15th century. Church was taken down c.1533 and sold to Vincent Grantham. Before the erection of commercial buildings on the site between 1851 and1868, it was an orchard and gardens. A stone coffin lid and six gargoyles were embedded in a brick wall of one of the buildings on the site demolished in 1950 (LE 08/05/1950 p 3 photo). From its style, it dated from the 11th century (pers comm Prof D Stocker). Human bones were also noted, and there were local recollections of many human burials removed during the construction of the NAAFI building. A house removed in 1892 (MON2784) was thought by some 19th-century antiquarians to be the church of All Saints Hungate, converted into dwellings after the Reformation (See Williamsons 1901 Guide to Lincoln). A squarish building is on the 1880s OS map at this point, 50m NE of the Naafi site.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

At the south end, a metalled surface, considered to be this road, was found at excavations in Cathedral Street in 1994 (tca94). The street may be late Saxon in origin; ""gate"" is Scandinavian for street, (street of the potters) and traces of a 10th-century pottery kiln (MON1023) were found in 1997 at the southern end, perhaps within a property facing on to Pottergate. The name Pottergate is recorded in 1179. (See Cameron (60), p.90-1). It was also called Holgate in 1619. (However, Holgate / Hole gate [MON1102) is shown on Marrats map of 1817 going due north to Greestone Stairs from Monks Road and joining Pottergate there; E J Willson marks it as ""The Old Road"" on his map.)

As the east-west road from medieval Clasket Gate, it followed the likely line of the Roman road issuing from a gate in the lower defences (about c.30m to the north of Clasket Gate, except at its western end, where it turns slightly south. Armstrongs 1779 map shows the road leaving the city in a north-east direction and making a junction with Greetwell Road. An engraving (Buck?) c.1786 shows a rural lane with fields either side with no structures except a small cluster at its west end next to the Clasket Gate (Abell MSS). Some efforts were made in the mid 19th-century to improve it as a public walkway, first in 1833 and 1836-1837, under the direction of the City Surveyor, Mr Hitchins, when levelling and consolidation of the roadway and the building of footways took place at the western end. Before that, it was an ""impassable morass"" (SM 01/07/1836 p col). It was then considered as one of Lincoln's picturesque walks. Metalling had taken place as far east as Milman Road by 1881, continuing eastwards as a lane.

Excavations in 1986 revealed foundations or walls of two phases of the south range and ancillary buildings. Watching brief in 1994 revealed associated walls, robber trenches and burials at the east side of the site. Major excavations in 1995 established the extent of the site boundaries; (on the south. probably a line between the railway platforms with the church of St Edward on the south; on the north, a boundary wall south of St Marks Churchyard; on the east, the High Street and on the west, the Witham.) The complex included a church and graveyard, a cloister to the north, incorporating ranges of buildings on its north-eastern side, and a kitchen surrounded by ancillary buildings on the north-western side. Some of the fabric may have survived demolition in the 16th century; the kitchen was possibly used into the 17th century; the inner cloister walls may have acted as boundary walls for the plot used for the building of later housing terrace.

The hospital was partly incorporated into St Catherines Priory (MON878 ) in c.1154 though the brethren continued to hold their own separate estate and managed their own finances. Baldwin Wake (circa 1205-13) granted certain parcels of land to the brethren and poor of the hospital. The hundred rolls show that the lay brethren held separate estates (Victoria County History). St Sepulchres seems to have developed a particular specialism in the care of orphaned and sick children, as there were at least 37 bequests to the ‰Û÷pupils and orphans of St Katherines‰Ûª in citizens wills written between 1271 and 1526 (Lincoln Archaeological Research Assessment). There was also an alms house or bedern.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

Instituted 4 November 1819 and officially opened 25 March 1820. It was built on two plots formerly known as Bowling Green Close and Great Carlines Piece, purchased from the Guardians of the Poor. The cost of construction was å£13000. The south front of the original main building was by Richard Ingleman (1777-1838), of three floors centrally, and of two floors to the sides. The original main entrance was on the corner of Union Road and Carline Road, where the Charlesworth statue now stands, closed when the statue was erected in 1854. The two rear single-storey extensions which were attached to the rear (north) of the original building c 1828 were given upper floors in 1835 and 1837. Improvements were made to bathrooms in 1870s and further building took place in the 1890s of offices, kitchens, dining hall, laundry, bathrooms, mortuary and the (Lawrence) hall. The name was changed from the Lincoln Asylum to the Lawn in 1885 and the Lawn Hospital for the Insane in 1889. Further additions were made in 1902 of a dining room, dormitory and lavatories. The grounds were expanded by the purchase of the plot to the north, previously rented. Charlotte House (MON2656) was built in 1938 as a nurses home. In 1948 the hospital was taken over by the Lincoln No. 2 Hospital Management Committee of the Sheffield Regional Hospital Board. Day hospital opened in 1963 and a childrens unit in 1967, residential in Charlotte House. Closed in 1985 and purchased by Lincoln City Council in 1986. The corridor in the internal courtyard was removed and the whole interior was covered to create the Lawrence Hall, with new north-south gallery added on the east side. Now meetings and entertainment centre, public house (the Inn on the Lawn, which closed in 2002 and was incorporated into the Lawrence Hall complex), museum of The Lawn (closed), Joseph Banks Conservatory (over a 1970 swimming pool), archaeology interpretative centre in Charlotte House (closed, now a hotel); offices, shops, tea rooms; venue for annual Christmas Market; childrens play area and picnic place etc. Offered for sale in 2011/2012 by the City of Lincoln Council, not including Charlotte House and the northern part.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

Outer gate by Bishop William Smith (1496-1514). Damaged during Lincolnshire Rising in 1536 but rapidly repaired. Much repaired by Bishop William Smith (1621-1641). It was used as a prison during Civil War in 1643 and fire-damaged also. The palace was then stripped of building materials and sold to Col James Berry in 1652 with chapel converted to a private residence. Much of the site was ruined, but continued to be occupied throughout 17th and 18th centuries. Lodging house converted into residence by Dr Edward Nelthorpe and Mrs Elizabeth Amcotts 1727-1740. 1838- conservation work begun by Charles Mainwaring, (architect E J Willson) adding stables and coach house and rebuilding inner gatehouse. The palace returned to the Diocese under Bishop Kay in 1841. Alnwick Tower restored by Bishop Wordsworth in 1876. Edward King House completed in 1888, with chapel in same year by Bodley and Garner in the West Hall.

A drawing by S Buck in the Bodleian Library is probably that of the conduit head, reusing architectural fragments as in St Marys conduit. The city acquired the conduit in 1539 and extended the system to St Marys conduit by 1543/4. The conduit at Greyfriars was a branch off the pipe which continued westwards under Saltergate. This structure was removed and replaced at the citys expense in 1732 by a faucet, situated on the south side of the Greyfriars building, although Marrat maps (1817-27 and 1848) record a square building on the east side of the building as a conduit.

It survives as the route of the footpath to City Hall east entrance. It may have led to a gate in the city wall to continue west as Midhergate in the medieval period (MON1151). It was called Aldusstigh/Aldussty in the 14th century, and possibly known as Silver Street in the late medieval period. The curved part from Park Street to Newland was called Crackpool Lane in the 1828 Valuation. Beaumont Fee was extended south from Park Street to Newland in 1884, although this section was also called Park Street on the 1907 OS map. The street was widened near the burial ground in 1895.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It may have stood in an open area on the edge of the street. A structure of octagonal shape, with alternate long and short sides of lengths average 3.35m and 1.98m with a diameter of 6.1m. It was constructed in two periods; 1. A base of limestone blocks set on larger slabs of Middle Lias marlstone orange-brown in colour; at the centre lower courses were replaced by a mass of tightly packed limestone rubble on which upper courses, long since removed, rested. A chamfered plinth on the bottom course was the consistent feature. The stones stood 1.07m high, in four courses. There was a shallow slot on the top course- a curved groove had been cut centrally along the slot. An opus signinum floor was on top of all this, in the centre of the structure. 2. The structure was enclosed by a tile wall- tiles (39cm x 29cm x 4cm) were laid in strong pink mortar, set very close to the stone face. The outer face of the wall was rendered by a coat of buff plaster, 2.5cm inch thick, which was smoothed and painted dark red. Also in the structure [phase 1) was an aperture designed to take a pipe, of which no trace remained- probably an outlet. See also nearby discovery of floors, possibly courtyard, in 1828 (MON6112). The presence of a fountain (perhaps used as a baptistery?) may have influenced the site of the churches of St Peter at Pleas and St Peter at Arches to the south.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

Here, the triple ditch was recorded by magnetometer survey, with a length of c.200m, its overall width being 10-15m, with individual ditches c1.5m-2m wide. In 2000 it was recorded in 6 out of 9 trial trenches with a width of 10m-12m, the individual ditches having a maximum depth of c.1m and widths of 1.2m to 2m. It was most intact close to the stream, where it had extended beneath colluvium. To the south of Wragby Road, the ditches terminated for a distance of c.100m northwards, possibly because of a natural feature such as woodland or a territorial entry. These terminals had been recut on several occasions. The break was bounded by a ditch (MON3484). Considered on pottery and environmental evidence to be late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age.

It connects Lincoln and the Witham to the Trent. Its cutting would have involved the straightening and rerouting of the River Till (MON1521). A 2005 borehole suggested that the River Till may have become redundant before the 12th century, but no firm date. The first documented work on the Fossdyke was when it was deepened in 1121. It was Crown property until James II presented it to the city of Lincoln by an act of 1671. There were frequent problems of flooding and silting but its use increased after improvements were made by Richard Ellison to whom it was leased for 999 years in 1741, and son Richard after 1743. It was deepened in the early 19th century and in 1840, by another descendant Richard Ellison. The Fossdyke was used at this time for the transport to Lincoln of coal, lime, cotton, linen and woollen goods, timber and pottery etc. and for the moving to the towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire of cattle, wool, wheat, barley and flour. Craft were sailing barges, horse-drawn and steam packets. The GNR took over the lease in 1846. Commercial water transport gradually declined with increasing competition from railways, but survived longer on the Fossdyke than on Witham. Barkers and Lee Smith were last Lincoln users of river barges, and the last water transport company was Furleys of Gainsborough in 1972.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It was widened on both sides and straightened in 1885, removing the kink in the centre (see Padley 1851 map), in 1894 at the White Horse (Tap and Spile) PH and in 1902 on the south side, with the removal of front gardens. The row of houses on the north side, replacing a row visible on Padley 1842 map, was demolished in the late 1970s and was then used as a surface a car park, to date. The row on the south side was restored in the ?1980s. It has been suggested that the line of the street was originally to the north to make a straight line to West Parade.

The eastern part between Yarborough Road and Orchard Street was called Beaumont Street/Place until 1882. The name Motherby Lane was also applied to the section between Beaumont Fee and Orchard Street up until 1882. Padleys 1842 map depicts the road west of Hungate surrounded by fields and brickyards. The only housing then was a row of nine houses on the south side between Orchard Street and The Park, and the house and grounds of Newland House (MON2639), which was accessed from Newland. The west end from Rudgard Lane to West Common was widened to 40 feet and extended to the Common in 1884-1886, over land donated to the city by R Carline and T Trotter. The section from Hungate to Beaumont Fee was realigned to run NW-SE in 1884, with the properties on the north side, 2-28 West Parade, inserted on the new alignment. Its link with Clasketgate, the West Parade Extension, via the new Corporation Street, was made in 1895, thereby replacing modern St Martins Street-Motherby Lane and Park Street as the main routes westwards.

At the western end, west of Rudgard Lane, it was called Fish Street up c.1850, followed by Far Newland. Earlier, Farr Newland in 1687. The west end was Newland Street in the 19th century, Far Newland to the east (Padley maps). It now terminates on the west side at Moor Street, but up to c.1895 it continued west and north through the old brickworks on the site of St Faiths School and joined West Parade close to West Common. The east end was the first part of the west end of the city to be built up with terraced housing in the early 19th century, (together with Gourleys Row and Gas Street), presumably because close by were the Gas Works, Brayford and Dawbers Depot Brewery.

Internal dumping raised the floor level by c.1.2m. In Room R3B, which would have been c.14.7m wide, an opus signinum floor and tessellated pavement were laid. It may have been subdivided by columns. 3A was possibly a portico, c.4m wide, with a mortar floor. The apsidal room R3C may have been flanked by columns. External gullies to the east may have served to drain the lower ground there. The building was abandoned by the end of the 4th century, although there was bone evidence for butchery being carried out in Room R3A. A large quantity of cast window glass, and some 4th century blown window glass, was recovered from the demolition deposits of the building. The remains were partially standing until final demolition and levelling c.1100. The west side of the structure was not found by excavation immediately to the west in 1981, nor was the south-east corner in 1982/3.

Also called West Hill. Progressively northwards, the walkway converges with the wall and overlies it. The present dog-leg to the east at the north end was probably made in the mid 1860s, certainly before Padleys 1868 map and the construction of the house ""Castle Mount"", at the top of the hill, probably connected to Henry East who owned land there. The 1887 and 1907 OS maps show flights of steps at intervals on the walkway. These have been removed to make a continuous slope. It was resurfaced with setts in 1992, and service trenches for the renewal of gas pipes were dug in 1999, replacing setts afterwards. It was built up with terraced housing from the 1850s onwards; by the 1890s 1-27 odds, 2-30 evens, Providence Row (c.1850) and Clara Terrace (c.1880).

It is unclear whether the church was built within the Green, or if the Green developed around the church. It has been suggested (City by The Pool) that it represents late 11th-century develoPaul Milesent in the Wigford suburb south of the Great Gowt, before the cutting of Sincil Dyke from the Witham eastwards, and the growth of properties. The Green would have extended much further south, as far as Swine Green, but the cutting of the Sincil Dyke effectively split the market in two. The shape is similar to the medieval market of Eastgate, and like that at Newport, which also contained a church. Until 1844, posts and chains lined the roadside to keep vehicles off the Green, but these were Removed in c1843 (SM 06/08/1841 p3; 16/03/1844 p3), and the space was abused by vehicles and rubbish. The present line of High Street north of the church, ie, further west, did not appear until the Green was offered for sale by the Corporation in five separate lots in March-October 1847 (LC 12/03/1847 p4),) was then enclosed, followed by the building of St Botolphs Terrace (438-465 High Street, MON3079) from c.1850. There was illegal encroachment on to the former pavement allowed by the parish but not by the Corporation. South of the church the High Street line had been built on by 1815 at least. St Botolphs Green is also recorded as an address, with two dwellings, in directories from the 1860s to the 1880s between 411 and 412 High Street; this location seems to be c.30m north of Queen Street.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The constable of the Castle may have benefited from the resulting tolls. It was held on Saturday evenings under the auspices of the Duchy of Lancaster in the rectangular square which developed between the East Gate of the Castle and Exchequer Gate. There seems to be no record of its grant, but it was still in operation in the 19th century as a vegetable market (Hill 1948, 101) and stallage was free to individuals, being paid to the Duchy by the parishes of St Margaret, St Mary Magdalene and St Peter in Eastgate (LC 08/11/1844 p2).  The right to collect these tolls was abandoned in 1847.

Even so, as it was held outside the jurisdiction of the city (being within the Bail), in the early modern era it may not have specialised in any particular product (unlike those in the Lower City).""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The rear courts, however, had been removed by the late 1950s. The north side properties have lasted longer, into the 1990s mostly, but there was increased demolition in late 1990s-2007 after a period of structural neglect.

By 1838 the Stamford Mercury was calling it Spring Hill, presumably ""Spring"" from the water springs on the hill. It was widened near Spring Hill School in 1910. According to Cameron (60) it was called Motherby Hill before Asylum Road, and the 1828 Evaluation names it Motherby Hill Road.  The name was officially changed from Asylum Road to Spring Hill in May 1902. It is not known when Spring Hill was first constructed. The earliest cartographic record was made by Speed on his map of 1607, but no carriageway is shown going up the hill north west of the junction with Beaumont Fee, as it is on Stukeleys 1722 map of the City, on which the road is shown with no structures. It would not be surprising, however, if there was an early diagonal route from the High Street, via Hungate, to the west side of the Castle and the road to Burton, matching Silver Street and Pottergate on the east side of the City. If evidence of the cemetery of St Peter Stanthaket is ever found on the west side of Spring Hill, it would therefore predate the street.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It was built by Erasmus Audley (d 1742), a joiner of Bailgate and a churchwarden at the church of St Mary Magdalene; a Mr Herbert was manager in 1750.  When offered for sale along with two houses in 1742, it was described as having ""Stage, Side Boxes, Seats, &c. to contain 40O People, and good Chambers over it"" (SM 07/10/1742 p4 col 1). Surviving playbills 1750-1763. It was visited 28/09/1766 by the Duke of York, the brother of George III. An E J Willson document ""Recollections"" p.93 in Soc of Antiquaries) refers to it as the ""Old Play House (in the Castle ditch), which was a warehouse occupied by a Mr Franklin ""then"" (Franklin held it in the 1830s). Converted into two cottages after c.1764 and leased by the Dean and Chapter to Robert Lely in 1773; a tenement ""now or lately made use of for a playhouse"", described as being 8 yards north-south and 22 yards east-west. A square building later used as a stable and coach house survived at the SE corner of the garden of 4 Castle Hill until c1900 and the south wall remains with a bricked-in oval window, next to the path to Romans Place restaurant. It was put up for sale with a larger property in 1838 ""a building formerly used as a Play-house, but now converted into a coach-house "" (SM 09/03/1838 p3). Acquired by Messrs Williams and Carline in 1843 as part of 4 Castle Hill. It is possible that the Harlequin Inn, Steep Hill, (MON616) was formally connected with the theatre, or simply that its proximity resulted in its role as the theatre inn. In May 2002, an Archaeological Watching Brief at 3 Drury Lane recorded a barrel-vaulted brick cellar which may possibly have been part of the theatre or the warehouse, but not if the building was to the north.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

A 1783 map shows properties on both sides of the lane to the west and north of Chad Varah House. At the instigation of Richard Carline in 1854,and financed by public subscription,  the line at the east end between Castle Hill and the later Wordsworth Street was moved eastwards to its modern position in 1855 having previously followed the line of the north-south running passageway to the east of the public toilets. This short stretch of passageway is called ""Old Drury Lane"" on a building application plan of 1912 (BA 5094). This necessitated the removal of one or two properties on the south side of Castle Hill (west of no. 3), one the house of DR Charlesworth.

Designed by architects Bellamy and Hardy in the Italianate style, builder William Huddlestone. It was built on land formerly owned by the Wilkinson Charity School on Bailgate and used as the Saracens Head garden (Stamford Mercury 17/04/1858). The foundation stone was laid 20 April 1859 by T Farmer of London. It opened 6 October 1859. Red brick with yellow brick and stone dressings, slate and concrete tile roofs. A two-storey western extension was added at the south end in 1878 to the houses and infants and girls classrooms, architects Bellamy and Hardy. New classroom in 1894, and further alterations in 1906, architect W Mortimer. 1897-closure, headmaster, Mr Humphries. It closed in stages 1927-1932 and girl pupils were transferred to Spring Hill School, boys to Hampton Street, and infants to Beaumont Fee. Disused and part demolished by the 1990s including the Girls and Infants Schools in the southern part, and what appears from the 1880s OS Town Plan to have been a dwelling on their north side, probably the head teachers house (boundary wall recorded, but interpreted as a toilet block, in 2003). The rear (west) buildings were demolished in October 2003. Restoration as part of a housing scheme in 2004-5 (Wesley Court).""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

Earliest found reference is a press mention of 1716 (SM 12/07/1716 p 11), and a lease of 1745 but it had been an inn since at least 1712. Occupant 1801-1812 William Harmston; 1815-1838 Thomas Handley; 1847-1863 John Thropp; 1878-1887 John Kirk; 1901-1903 R Taylor. The building retains remnants of earlier timber framing and a stone cellar. A regular haunt of Cathedral bell ringers in the 19th century. It was formerly nos 3 and 5 (in 1867) and was an office for the issuing of hawkers licences in 1830. The west wall collapsed in 1866 (LC 03/08/1866 p 5 col 2). Additions were made for Hewitt and Co/Bros in 1902. Major refurbishment in 1964. Owned by the membership since 1993. A rear outbuilding belonged to 30 Steep Hill until 1855 when Drury Lane was cut through to Castle Hill east of its former position, leaving the outbuilding separated; also, it is likely that the rear gabled-ended extension was rebuilt with an angle and curved wall at the south-east corner to follow this new street alignment.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The foundation stone was laid on 1st September 1847 and opened in April 1848. The cost was å£15000.  It was found to be too small, so was enlarged in 1853 with the addition of the west end at a cost of å£1000. Constructed of stone and yellow brick. The west end is square with prostyle Corinthian portico of 4 columns supporting a pediment. Balustrade between columns. Corinthian pilasters on corners, doubled on north and south elevations. Tall sash windows on north south and east sides. Main body of building on east side, with 5 bays containing triple windows. North side has raised walkway accessing shops. South side has windows at ground level. East end is semicircular, with windows of curved glass. Moulded cornice all round with parapet above. It operated as exchange until a larger building was required and the new Corn Exchange (MON1671) was built in 1879/1880. Called Exchange Arcade after that when converted into shops. In 1882 the building was altered to create an arcade with 12 small shops on either side of a central walkway, with a larger shop at east and west ends. This arrangement continued until the 1950s when the walkway was moved to the north side, with 6 shop units extending the width of the building. The basement/cellar was Hattons Tea Rooms from the early 1900s until the 1930s; in 1939 it was intended for use as an air raid shelter; 1950s a store for bananas; it was part-renovated in 1976, with the cellar opening as Cornhill Vaults PH in December 1976 until closure c2000. Dimensions of building c 52m x 42m. In 2002, the whole of the eastern part of the building was gutted except for the external walls; a lift and new piles were inserted and a completely new open-plan interior created. Brick culverts were recorded at the western end below cellar level. Unoccupied 2002-2004. 2005- Waterstones bookshop.

Occupants; John Dudding, solicitor 1831-1840s. 1884-1900 J W Danby; The extensive rear garden, as depicted on Padleys 19th-century maps, contains two structures, one a vinery (MON1996, c1840) later converted into a garage and part of the property of Stonegarth, the other to the SW of this, of unknown function. The vinery incorporates stonework of an early date and is marked SD (sun dial) on the 1930 OS map. To the north was a roughly circular structure which appears on maps up to 1930, at least. It is not known if this was part of 18 Eastgate or associated with the path in which it stood. The garden extended west on to what is now the roadway of Northgate, until the street was widened in the 1930s. Possibly the site of the earlier Old Tavern (MON2214). The garden now also contains 20th-century houses and their gardens: Stonegarth, Danby House, 1-2 Eastgate Close and 4 Nettleham Road.

More additions in 1932. 1970, Eastgate First School, later reverting to an infants school. The entrance has a date stone above of 1851 and the letters hMC (Harriet Margaret Cookson?). Below is an inscribed scroll (partly illegible, but probably ""Train up a child in the way he should go"" from Proverbs 22.6). Fine main door with fancy iron hinges in an off-centre recessed entrance bay with a buttressed gabled porch, with 4-centred arched doorway with hoodmould.

It rises c16km north west of Stamford, flows north through Grantham to Lincoln, entering Brayford Pool at the Holmes Crossing at Brayford Wharf East and leaving it at Brayford Head. It continues along Waterside, through Stamp End and eastwards, before turning south east before Bardney and running to Boston, then reaching the Wash at Claypole. The part before Lincoln is the upper Witham. The value of the lower Witham was for vessels to reach the sea en route to London and elsewhere, not only from Lincoln, but also from the Midlands via the Trent and Fossdyke. It is not known when the river was first canalised, but it was possibly during the Roman occupation. Sincil Dyke, leaving the Witham at Altham Terrace and rejoining it at Stamp End, may have been dug at the same time. In 1846 the Witham was leased to the GNR. River trade declined throughout the rest of the 19th century with competition from the railways. Barkers and Lee Smith were the last Lincoln users of river barges, and the last water transport company was Furleys of Gainsborough in 1972. Many of Lincolns major industrial companies were sited on Waterside and upper Witham for reasons of transport and water supply. Extensive earlier tanning took place on the east of the upper Witham west of High Street. Bore hole evidence (2004) showed that the upper Witham south of Brayford extended further west than the present course.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

Attached to the north side were two wheelhouses and a machinery room. The upper floor contained ten cells, including one condemned cell, a turnkeys room and one other room.

A north-south rough limestone wall recorded in 1985 may have been from these houses, or a boundary wall.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

Construction of brick painted black. Door on ground level. Horizontally sliding square windows with stone sills and segmental arches. G W Whitton in 1918, when a garage was added to the complex, and gas was being used. Mill was still in working order in 1940, but lost its sails in 1941, when Frank Ellis was the miller. It gradually fell into disrepair and was set on fire and gutted in 1970s. Restored by Lincoln Civic Trust 1977-1981. Restoration work led by Chris Salisbury, millwright. The cap was made from a mould of that of Sturton mill. Milling began again in 1981. Lincolnshire C C took it over in 25/10/1995. Padleys maps of C19th label it ""f"" and it is the second mill from the south in the row. There are documentary references to mills here from the early 16th century (Hill F Medieval Lincoln, 337). The brick foundations of an ancillary building in the north-east part of the site were recorded in 2006, along with a short length of brick wall and a stone wall or foundation immediately north of the mill.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

Some former occupants of 64 Newland recorded in street directories/press include; 1145 Elizabeth Patterson; 1848, J Wooldridge, stationer; 1857-1860, John Smith; 1860-1866 Miss M Bacons School for young ladies; 1867-1874, Joseph Nesbit, maltster and merchant; 1874 the school of the Misses Vipan; 1877-1878, George Maples Fox, ironmonger silversmith etc; 1881-1904, Joseph Maltby JP, (of Battle Son and Maltby, chemists, High Street) and widow; 1905 M Dawber; 1913, Joseph Cooper, (fishmonger, High St). It was converted into the City Maternity Home in 1919 and operated as Newland Day Nursery from the ?1960/70s to the 1990s. Its use until c 2002 was as offices for the West Area Young Offenders Team, (DeveloPaul Milesent House). The building has been subject to alterations since its construction. Before the 1840s, 66 Newland, a shop (MON3429, demolished in February 1993) had been attached on the north side of its west end (Padleys 1842 map of Lincoln) From the same map evidence, 64 occupied the same footprint as today for most of its length, but was c6.5m longer to the west, with a small south extension on the west end of the south elevation. The unbalanced fenestration on the frontage also suggests that 64 Newland had once been longer on this side. The windows on the west elevation, visible during the 1993 demolition, were of a shape different to those on the frontage. By 1851, the existing longer south extension had been added, on the east of and abutting the earlier one. Outbuildings and a greenhouse were built in the rear garden, which could be entered by Short Lane to the south, shown clearly in the 1887 OS map. When 66 Newland was demolished in 1993, the west gable of 64 was rebuilt and the small rear extension was removed. The western part of the building, recorded as being part of 64 on the 1887 OS map, seems to have been acquired by 66 at some stage, and was removed in 1993 along with the extension. The present length of the building is now c12m, compared with c18.5m according to the 1887 map. The following sequence of construction of numbers 64 and 66 is suggested:
1) Late 18th century Construction of 64 Newland, set back c.6.25m from the pavement of Newland
2) 1800-1840 Construction of the shop building, 66 Newland, on the frontage of the west part of 64, extending to the pavement. Addition of pitched roof 2-storey extension to the rear. Acquisition by 66 of the west part of 64, with internal alterations to separate the two parts; the removal of the internal 2-floor arrangement in the west part, and replacement with three floors with refenestration.
3) 1842-1851 Addition of existing 3-storey rear extension
4) 1960s? Addition of existing extension on the south-east corner of 64.5) 1993 Demolition of 66, the west part of 64, and the earliest rear extension.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The land was first bought in 1824 by Ann Seely and the mill is on the 1839 Dewhurst and Nichols map but not on Dawsons 1835 map. It probably had 5 or 6 sails. Seely sold to Lily and Hibbert in 1841, thence it passed to Henry Lister in ?1845-1849 (bankrupt in 1849), Wm. Dawber in 1862, and C S Dickinson in 1870. By 1851 Padley map, associated buildings have been built on east and south sides, probably in 1847. The first use of supplementary steam power was in the 1840s. Sails were destroyed by a storm in 1863 and not replaced. Acquired by Henry Le Tall in 1871. New flour warehouse in 1873, builder Huddleston; another in 1876, builder George Bacon. The first rollers installed in 1882, with a new system replacing them in 1886. Boiler house in 1884, architect W Mortimer. New stables and out offices 1882, third floor added to dressing chamber in 1884. New boiler room and stables in 1891, architect W Mortimer. New 3-floor warehouse in 1892, architect W Mortimer and Son. The steam mill was built along with a new warehouse in 1894/5 by builders S and R Horton and Sons [see photo and advert in Ruddocks City directory of 1913). New dray shed in 1899. New chimney applied for in 1902. In 1920 it was completely overhauled. Electricity sub-station added in 1948. The last milling took place in 1961. Leased and then in 1967 sold to Frank Wright and Son for grain drying and storage. A tall industrial chimney was demolished in 1987 for reasons of safety. Converted into apartments in 1990-92, with new dome cap installed in 1994. The tower has 8 stages, of red brick with reglazed windows and doors to the east and west at ground level. A gantry at the 5th stage was removed in the ?1980s but a replica was replaced 20-25 Sep 2000. Formerly Building At Risk 030""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The site was occupied c1840s-1850s by William Singleton, rope maker, who joined with John Jekyll, vetinerary surgeon of Carholme Road, later Newland. The Padley 1851 map shows the present building with the cottages in the centre of the plot. The site was chosen for the proximity of the Fossdyke for transport and as a source of water, as well as its distance from the city at the time.  William Gresham joined Jekyll and Singleton by 1856 for a short-lived association, manufacturing chemical manure. The business was wound up and re-emerged as Jekyll, Glasier and Pratt in 1857 lasting until 01/09/1881, when Pratt left. The firm then became Jekyll, Glasier and Co. On Padley 1868 map new large buildings are shown to the south of the first structure stretching to the Fossdyke and on the east side is a north-south water channel, not connected with the Fossdyke, which was filled in by 1886. The OS map of 1886 shows further rebuilding and expansion. From 1881-1920, Jekyll, Glasier and Co., now producing feeding cake, calf meal and sheep dip under ""Anchor "" trade mark. In 1920 taken over and operated by Doughty, Son and Richardson Fertilisers Ltd until at least 1947, changing name to Doughty-Richardson Fertilisers Ltd in 1930s and Doughty Goole Fertilisers some time before 1940. Fisons took over site in 1940s-1980s. From c1920 the factory was connected to the rail network by a private siding passing over the Fossdyke by a drawbridge. See also SOURCE 1230 for article and drawing of frontage. All that remains is Fosse House, an industrial warehouse building and 2 attached cottages which were renovated 1989-90 and are now offices. It is a rectangular 3-storey building of red and yellow brick with a gabled slate roof. The south elevation has been substantially altered and added to. The north facade appears to be mainly original, apart from replacement windows. Ground floor; central double doors with 2 square windows on each side. 1st floor; 6 pilasters in yellow brick contain 5 bays, the central having a tall plain window, perhaps former loading bay, the 4 others with a 3-panel window. The 2nd floor is similar, but with short rectangular windows. All these windows are divided vertically into 3 panels. The east elevation has a ground floor door and a plain window on the 1st and 2nd floors. On the west side is attached a pair of 2-storey terraced cottages in red brick with slate roof, hipped at the west end with a shared chimney stack. Each has an entrance door with projecting surrounds of blue and yellow brick, and 2 tall sash windows.

Contractors Samuel Morton Peto and Edward Ladd Betts. The GNRs engineer was Joseph Cubitt.  The land appears from Padleys 1842 map to have been a large paddock to the east of a house (c328-331?) High Street stretching back to Sincil Dyke. The station buildings chief material is grey brick and the general style is mock Tudor. The main buildings are on the north side dominated by a square tower on the platform on the east of the buildings. The main entrance building is 2 storied and H shaped with gables facing the frontage with a modern canopy between. On either side are 2 storied wings. On the west side are single storey parcel offices, the first with wide arched door and flanking windows, the next with gable and flat frontage, repeated. A feature of the station is the inclusion of many tall thin ornate chimney stacks.  On the north east of the station is an enclosed car park, with a boundary wall of yellow brick. At the east end of the station was a footbridge, dating from the 1880s, for crossing the tracks. It was cast iron with diamond lattice parapets. Each end rested on 4 cast iron circular columns rising from the platforms and was approached on its west side by 2 flights of steps separated by a flat platform section. The footway and steps were roughly cut wooden beams. The flights on each end sat on 2 pairs of cast iron columns and have iron handrails. At the ends of the west side of the bridge were decorated cast iron brackets. The span was also supported on 2 modern steel braced girder piers between the tracks. This bridge was dismantled and replaced in 1999, with new lifts, partly reusing elements of the old bridge. There was also an earlier covered footbridge at the west end of the station built in 1869 surviving until the ?1980s. It was popularly used as a public way from High Street to St Marys Street when the crossing gates were closed, as the station could be entered from this end via Station yard off High Street by the side of the GNR Stables. A turntable was positioned on the north side of the station on the site of the enclosed car park. In 1884 canopies were built over the platforms and adjacent track supported on rows of slender columns on the platforms and between the tracks. Glass panes on the ridge gave light. They were removed in the ?1960s. Platforms 1 and 2 on the north side were removed in 1989 to make car park. Platform 8 on the south side was out of use by the 1980s. The first service was the GNR loop line from Peterborough via Boston. The finger signalling system was replaced by lights in the summer of 2008, with the closure of signal boxes. Railway tracks were realigned and relaid, and platforms (4/5) lengthened.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The ends rest on abutments of blue engineering bricks with two intermediate piers of cut stone blocks surmounted by courses of blue engineering bricks. The bridge was opened in December 1848 to carry the Manchester Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway into the Midland (Central) Station. The first bridge was of tubular construction designed by John Fowler. According to the Lincs Chronicle ""the bridge...is somewhat on the principle of the tubular bridge over Menai Straits- The weight of the rails and the traffic over them is supported by two immense girders of iron, which rest upon cross girders, or sleepers, extending from and fastened to two copper tubes, six feet in height, 18 inches wide, and in length from pier pier, and which bear the weight of the whole"" (LC 01/12/1848 p 2 col 4). In 1903 it was reconstructed on the original piers retaining the box sections. [See Ruddock p 123 (SOURCE 415)) It is probably the oldest surviving example in active use of the Patent Girder Bridge designed and patented by William Fairbairn.

It has traditionally been interpreted as a representation of St Peter or Jesus Christ. David Stocker has argued for it being an image of the Roman Mithraic god Arimanius. There is a statue of this god from York. It may have been incorporated into the 11th-century tower because of the mistaken attribution to St Peter, or as a deliberate reinforcement of the Christianisation of old Roman deities. The figure is wearing a tunic or skirt with waistband, has an elongated, possible lions, head and holds two unidentifiable objects.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

It was originally 5m high and was placed on the top of Dunston Pillar in 1808 to replace a ""lighthouse"" light. The pillar had been erected by Lord Despencer.  The statue was designed by Mrs Coade and modelled by Joseph Panzetta, in Coade Stone, after a commission from the Earl of Buckingham. Only the bust has been displayed in the Castle since the removal of the statue from the pillar during WWII because it presented a hazard for low-flying aircraft. The bust was restored 2007-2010 and placed back on display October 2010 on the existing base. The remainder of the statue is in storage in the Castle.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,

The 1842 map shows 1-3 as one building, with a division to 4, which appears to have been attached to 3 only at ground-floor level, as the brickwork above has a straight joint. In addition, there is a flat band at first-floor level on 1-3, but not on 4. Padleys 1851 map shows the four--fold division, with rear outbuildings, probably toilets and sheds. It is suggested that 4 was a single-storey building which was built up to roof level when the houses were created in their present form c1842-50. A new rear kitchen extension was added to number 3 in May 2002, replacing an earlier extension. 4 has a rear first-floor horizontal extension above that of the ground floor. Also, 4 was made into a holiday rental home in 2008/9. On the frontage, each house has a door and one vertical sash window, of 2 x 6 panes, on each floor.

The building was the offices of a business first established in the 1860s by Joseph Fambrini, later joined by J Daniels, artificial stone (concrete or a material similar to coadstone) manufacturers, whose works were first at 34 Newton Street (MON6734) from c.1877-1885; by 1878 they also occupied 81-85 Canwick Road and built a workshop at the rear in that year, architects Drury and Mortimer; another added in 1892 with additions in 1899. The Fambrini family home was the ""Villa Firenze"" 95, Monks Road (MON2906). The company provided mouldings for the domes, finials and decorative panels on the stepped gables of Southport Opera House, Lord Street, Southport (1890-91) by Matcham. They were described in The Builder as being of imperishable red concrete masonry. Info from: http://www.gosforth3.demon.co.uk/chapter_four.htm. The Opera House, with a capacity for 2000, opened 7th September 1891 and was destroyed by fire 1929. From c1913 to at least the 1930s 85 was occupied by Lindum Stone Company, who added a showroom in 1920, and in the 1980s by Tinker and Lucas, joiners. It appeared to be residential in 1999. Rear outbuildings removed in 2003.""",eb3bd719-c473-40b8-bf0a-cdb9ed89aba3,,,,,
